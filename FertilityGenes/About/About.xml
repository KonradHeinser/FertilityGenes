I have a fertility problem. I also have a freudian problem, but I can only solve one of those with a mod. This is a mod that adds more fertility genes to the list. Nothing else. In theory, it should be compatible with any other gene mod, though any gene mod that adds fertility genes has a chance to be incompatible. Let me know if you find one, and I'll see if I can rectify the issue.

I made this mod because I noticed that I couldn't find any mods that didn't have this stuff mixed in with other things, if they had them at all. This mod is primarily for those who don't want extra genes on their list, or just plain can't find mods that add fertility choices to the menu(like me).

Want to change chances of lovin'? I made a separate mod for that: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2974405875
Want to see these genes integrated into Biotech? Try this: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2976573675
