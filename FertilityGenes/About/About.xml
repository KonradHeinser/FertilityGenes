I have a fertility problem. I also have a freudian problem, but I can only solve one of those with a mod. This is a mod that adds more fertility genes to the list. Nothing else. In theory, it should be compatible with any other gene mod, though any gene mod that adds fertility genes has a chance to be incompatible. Let me know if you find one, and I'll see if I can rectify the issue.

I made this mod because I noticed that I couldn't find any mods that didn't have this stuff mixed in with other things, if they had them at all.
